# Keylogger
Keylogger with Tkinter
This project is a simple keylogger implemented using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical interface. The keylogger captures keystrokes, displays them in a Tkinter window, and stops logging when the 'Esc' key is pressed. This tool can be used for educational purposes to understand how keyloggers work.

Features
Captures and displays keystrokes in real-time.
Handles special keys like Tab, Backspace, Enter, and Space.
Displays modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt) appropriately.
Stops logging and closes the application when 'Esc' is pressed.
